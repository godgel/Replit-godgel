      Hello..! My Name is <strong>Nam-Seok</strong>
      I work for an electrician now, but I really want to change my job as a Front-End-Developer in React.js Field....Long time ago...About 20 years ago..I had worked as a web programmer, 
      
      In those days, I used linux, php, mysql..Etc...But I forgot almost everything of them. Because I have not used them at all.
      
      And  in that time, The I.M.F economic crisis cracked down my whole life. So I had to choose hardship worker which is called "NoGaDa in Korean". 
      Later, Luckly, I saw The AD. in the subway train that "everybody can be an electrician if you are ready to be educated in our institute...Blah...blah.....
      
      So I am working in the Apartment building maintenance office now, But Some people doing overuse their power, so I got a lot of stress. 
      It is notorious in Korea. We call it "Gap-Jil". 
      Anyway, That's reason enough to change my job, in the near future.
      
      Now, I realized that I was loving programming itself in those days.
      
      I will do my best at least for 5 years...after that, In 5 years, I dont'n know what will happen in my future life, I always welcome it whatever they are. Who knows..?, my future life is better than now, That is the Hope of My Life...Thanks...
